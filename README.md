# MIRCV Projects

## IR_Project
The notebook already shows outputs for every cell. If you wish to run it, it must be run on a Kaggle environment. Here is a [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/filippolucchesi/ir-project-pulpfiction) to the notebook on Kaggle.

## LM_Project
This notebook shows outputs for every cell as well. Kaggle doesn't allow us to share this notebook with other users because of its size. However, there should be no problem running it on other environments. In case plots don't show up for any reason, we have included them in the images folder.
